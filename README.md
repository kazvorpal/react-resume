This is A VERY SIMPLE demo of my resume in a single, CSR React/Redux file using Babel, all through CDN. 

It is meant as a code sample, NOT an example of my web design (the look of the site) skills.

In it, I use client-side rendering via Babel, so that you can download all of the code and run it as a single file, without having to deal with the server settings.

The data used, by the way, isn't my current resume, it's a JSON version of my resume that I don't update as often as I do the PDF version.

You can view the running code at https://kazvorpal.github.io/resume-react/
